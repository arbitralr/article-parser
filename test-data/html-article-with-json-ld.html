            "articleBody": "Stocks dropped on Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into a bear market for the first time since early in the pandemic, as investors feared the effects of higher inflation, rising interest rates and the risk of a recession.The S&P 500 was down about 1.6 percent in intraday trading, pushing the benchmark index into bear market territory, a Wall Street term for a 20 percent decline from a recent peak — in this case, since Jan. 3. It is a symbolically important marker of investor pessimism, and the index would have to close the day at this level to officially enter a bear market.The S&P 500 is also on track for its seventh consecutive weekly decline, an unusually long losing streak.The pessimism in Wall Street has been prompted by fears about stubbornly high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s plans to increase interest rates in response, which could tip the economy into recession . The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China have added to these concerns.Downbeat earnings reports from bellwether retailers like Walmart and Target this week have dragged down markets, stoking fears that high inflation may be making consumers, who power the U.S. economy, more cautious.“The reality is the market is likely to remain under pressure until peak inflation has been priced in,” Fiona Cincotta, a senior financial markets analyst at Forex.com, wrote in a research note. “We aren’t there yet.”Since World War II, bear markets have almost always been closely accompanied by recessions, with a few exceptions, like the stock market crash of 1987. But there are recent examples of markets brushing close to a bear market when a recession never resulted, according to LPL Financial. The S&P 500 came within a percentage point of the bear-market threshold in 1998, 2011 and 2018 but never tipped over the line.",

Nonetheless, Mr. Berezin says the U.S. is not headed for a recession. His reason: consumers and businesses, helped by government stimulus, are in better shape than prior to the previous recession. “The difference between what the private sector earns and spends is still in surplus,” he wrote. “This stands in contrast to the lead-up to both the 2001 and 2008-9 recessions.” ",

            "articleBody": "Much of the drama in markets right now ties back to the Federal Reserve, which is raising interest rates to try to contain the fastest inflation in 40 years — and curbing economic progress in the process.By making money more expensive to borrow, the Fed’s policies work to slow consumer and business demand, cooling the economy. Its rate moves come as the global economy faces other big threats: Chinese lockdowns meant to control the spread of the coronavirus are roiling factories and shipping routes, and the war in Ukraine is ramping up uncertainty and causing food shortages.“It’s not just the Fed, or China, or Ukraine — it’s all three,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a rates strategist at T.D. Securities. “There is a fear that the Fed will have to tighten to control inflation, and that will make the rest of the economy and markets collateral damage.”The Fed lifted its policy interest rate in both March and May, has signaled that more rate increases are coming, and is preparing to pare back its holdings of bonds starting next month. Those policies combine to make it more costly to buy a house, expand a business or fund a car purchase using debt. The point is to rein in consumer spending, hiring and economic actively broadly — allowing supply to catch up with demand so that prices come down.Policymakers have acknowledged that it will be difficult to get inflation down without causing a recession, which is likely part of the reason investors are spooked.The effect the Fed is having on stock and other asset markets this year is compounded by the fact that central banks around the world are lifting their own policy rates, too, as high inflation hits many countries.The bear market in stocks is unlikely to change the Fed’s course in the next few months, strategists said.“Right now, they are very singularly focused on inflation,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale.Fed policymakers have signaled that they want to raise interest rates “ expeditiously ” to a level at which they are no longer boosting the economy, and have suggested that they might lift borrowing costs by half a percentage point at each of their next two meetings. Once they have done that, Ms. Rajappa said she could see the turmoil in markets beginning to influence the central bank’s view, perhaps prompting them to slow the pace of rate increases late this year.“Financial conditions are tightening dramatically — that has to be something that they are watching closely,” she said.",

The Nasdaq composite, a benchmark that’s heavily weighted toward technology stocks, has been in bear market territory since early March. The declines have come as investors grapple with the combination of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in sanctions that severely limited gas supplies; global supply chain problems as the coronavirus pandemic grinds on; and an inflation problem that is prompting the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates quickly.The 20 percent trigger for a bear market — like the 10 percent trigger for what investors call a “correction” — is a somewhat arbitrary threshold. But it serves as a mile marker to show that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market.There is skepticism about the use of the terms correction and bear market, whose precise definitions have been in use only since the 1980s . Corrections are not uncommon, with the last one having started in January of this year, one of nearly a dozen since 2000 .Some corrections don’t last very long, like one in 2018, which lasted less than two weeks. In some instances, stocks regained their previous peaks in a few months.",

                more than pandas! The chicken is a shark; A turtle can hardly be considered a kind horse without also
                being a pomegranate. Zebras are witty persimmons.
